# React + Vite

install the React-vite app using following command

cd Todo
npm install
npm run dev

Features: 1. Add todo
          2. Remove todo
          3. Check completed task
          4. Store data in localstorage and fetch when page refresh

Note:- I don't think there is need of useEffect hook here so I didn't use. We can use useEffect to fetch the initial data from localStorage but I did that in another way.

 Frontend Library:- Tailwind css
  Redux:-  Used Reduxjs/toolkit instead of traditional Redux
